# Eliza-Kiln-Plugin   
A Kiln Connect integration plugin for Eliza that provides access to Kiln Connect's various APIs and services.    

This project is a plugin of [Eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza)

# Why
From January 31st to February 2nd 2025, I participated in Kiln's Hackathon. During this weekend, I explored the emerging Web3 narrative around AI Agents. My team developed a custom plugin that enables our AI agent to interact with Kiln Connect's API. After such a rewarding experience, I've decided to continue developing this project.

# Configuration
The plugin require environment variable to be set in your project .env:
```.env
KILN_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
